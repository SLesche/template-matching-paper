The template matching algorithm introduced in this paper offers a robust, objective, and efficient method for extracting individual differences in P3 latencies, outperforming traditional approaches like peak and fractional area latency methods. By providing accurate latency recovery, high validity across varied conditions, and a fit statistic for quality control, it enhances reliability and automation in ERP analysis. Its straightforward implementation makes it ideal for multiverse studies and automated pipelines, advancing research reproducibility and efficiency.
